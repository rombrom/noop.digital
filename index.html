        <strong>noop</strong> builds things for the Web. I can make things
        pretty, I can make things easy and I can make them accessible. Most of
        all, I can make things work ðŸ‘Œ
      </p>

      <p>
        I've been doing this for 20 years and have gotten pretty good at it

      <h2>Front End / Full Stack Developer</h2>

        Front end development is my expertise. I've worked with a lot of back
        ends too. I've done it across a variety of industries and many amazing
        teams ðŸ«¶
      </p>

      <p>
        I've worked with <em>a lot of web technologies.</em><sup>*</sup> I love
        to keep things as simple as possible. This yields least friction for
        people and delights users. I encourage others to learn and stay curious.
        I believe autonomy and responsibility are keys to growth ðŸŒ±

      <p>
        <small>
          * Core web technologies and APIs for authoring web experiences, a lot
          of popular libraries and ("meta-" <small>lol</small>) frameworks. Cool
          databases too. There's a lot of things I've become fluid with. I'll do
          some namedropping in the next paragraph:

      <p>
        <small>
          Next.js & Remix (this one I like better), React (comes with that
          territory), Svelte and SvelteKit (love these), and any other front end
          framework. PostgreSQL, Redis, and pub/sub systems. NodeJS backends and
          frameworks like Apollo Server, Express (choose Hono though), and
          popular CLIs. Blockchain technologies and its libraries on EVM and
          Solana based blockchains. I used to work with a lot of PHP frameworks
          like Laravel, CraftCMS and WordPress. Nowadays I think sync engines
          and progressive web applications are cool.
